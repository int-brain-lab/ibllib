## Contribution and development practices
See https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblenv/07_contribution.html

We use Semantic Versioning.

Before committing to your branch:
-   run tests
-   flake8
This is also enforced by continuous integration.


## Matlab Library
The Matlab library has moved to its own repository here: https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibllib-matlab/
