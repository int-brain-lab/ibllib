    "# Data Release - Brain Wide Map\n",
    "\n",
    "IBL aims to understand the neural basis of decision-making in the mouse by gathering a whole-brain activity map composed of electrophysiological recordings pooled from multiple laboratories. We have systematically recorded from nearly all major brain areas with Neuropixels probes, using a grid system for unbiased sampling and replicating each recording site in at least two laboratories. These data have been used to construct a brain-wide map of activity at single-spike cellular resolution during a [decision-making task]((https://elifesciences.org/articles/63711)).  In addition to the map, this data set contains other information gathered during the task: sensory stimuli presented to the mouse; mouse decisions and response times; and mouse pose information from video recordings and DeepLabCut analysis. Please read our accompanying [technical paper](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21400815) for details on the experiment and data processing pipelines. To explore the data, visit [our vizualisation website](https://viz.internationalbrainlab.org/)."

    "## Overview of the Data\n",
    "We have released data from 354 Neuropixel recording sessions, which encompass 547 probe insertions, obtained in 115 subjects performing the IBL task across 11 different laboratories. As output of spike-sorting, there are 295501 units; of which 32766 are considered to be of good quality. These units were recorded in overall 194 different brain regions.\n",
