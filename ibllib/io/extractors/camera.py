    Align the GPIO pin state to the DAQ sync TTLs.  Any sync TTLs not reflected in the pin
    state are removed from the dict and the times of the detected fronts are converted to DAQ

      - The input gpio and TTL dicts may be modified by this function.
      - For training sessions the frame rate is only 30Hz and the TTLs tend to be broken up by
      small gaps.  Setting the min_diff to 5ms helps the timestamp assignment accuracy.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Some sync TTLs appear to be so short that they are not recorded by the camera.  These can
    be as short as a few microseconds.  Applying a cutoff based on framerate was unsuccessful.
    Assigning each sync TTL to each pin state change is not easy because some onsets occur very
    close together (sometimes < 70ms), on the order of the delay between TTL and frame time.
    Also, the two clocks have some degree of drift, so the delay between sync TTL and pin state
    change may be zero or even negative.

    Here we split the events into sync TTL onsets (lo->hi) and TTL offsets (hi->lo).  For each
    uptick in the GPIO pin state, we take the first TTL onset time that was within 100ms of it.
    We ensure that each sync TTL is assigned only once, so a TTL that is closer to frame 3 than
    frame 1 may still be assigned to frame 1.
