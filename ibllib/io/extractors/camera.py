    Some audio TTLs appear to be so short that they are not recorded by the camera.  These can
    be as short as a few microseconds.  Applying a cutoff based on framerate was unsuccessful.
    Assigning each audio TTL to each pin state change is not easy because some onsets occur very
    close together (sometimes < 70ms), on the order of the delay between TTL and frame time.
    Also, the two clocks have some degree of drift, so the delay between audio TTL and pin state
    change may be zero or even negative.

    Here we split the events into audio onsets (lo->hi) and audio offsets (hi->lo).  For each
    uptick in the GPIO pin state, we take the first audio onset time that was within 100ms of it.
    We ensure that each audio TTL is assigned only once, so a TTL that is closer to frame 3 than
    frame 1 may still be assigned to frame 1.
