        Extract the Bpod trial events.

        For iblrig versions < 8.13 the Bpod state machine for this task had extremely misleading names!
        The 'iti' state was actually the delay between valve close and trial end (the stimulus is
        still present during this period), and the 'trial_start' state is actually the ITI during
        which there is a 1s Bpod TTL and gray screen period.

        In version 8.13 and later, the 'iti' state was renamed to 'post_reward' and 'trial_start'
        was renamed to 'iti'.
