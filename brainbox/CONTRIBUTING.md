# Contributing to Brainbox

Things you need to be familiar with before contributing to Brainbox:
* Fundamentals of Python programming and how to use NumPy for math
* How to use Git and GitFlow to contribute to a repository
* Our guidelines on how to write readable and understandeable code

Below is a guide which will take you from the ground up through the process of contributing to the brainbox software package. Some of these sections may already be familiar to you, but it may be worth skimming them again in case you've forgotten some of the nuances of using python, git, github, or unit tests.

# Installing the right python environment (10 minutes)

**TL;DR: We provide an `environment.yml` file. Use Anaconda to create an environment which only contains the packages Brainbox needs.**

We suggest using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which is developed by continuum.io, as your basis for developing Brainbox. Begin by downloading the most recent version of Python 3 Anaconda for your operating system. Install using the installation instructions on the Anaconda website, and make sure that you can interact successfully with the `conda` command in either a terminal (OS X, Linux) or in the Anaconda Prompt provided on Windows.

Once you have installed Anaconda, the next step is to create an environment for working with brainbox. This requires you to have the `environment.yml` file which lives in the top directory of this repository. We will just clone the whole repository now though, since you will need it later, using the following command on *nix systems:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/int-brain-lab/brainbox
```

Note: please navigate to the folder where you want to run this command beforehand, e.g. `/home/username/Documents` if you want the `brainbox` repository to live in your Documents folder

For Windows users we recommend using [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) as a Windows TTL emulator, which will allow for you to run the above command without any changes. That software also includes a graphical git interface which can help new users.

Once you have cloned the repository and downloaded Anaconda, navigate to the top level of Brainbox where the `environment.yml` file is, then run the following command in a terminal or Anaconda prompt session:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Type "yes" when prompted and conda will install everything you need to get working on brainbox! After this you will need to run

```bash
conda activate bbx
```

if you are developing from the terminal, in order to activate the environment you just installed. **Always do this when you create a new terminal to develop Brainbox! This way you don't code in packages that brainbox doesn't support!** 

# Git, GitFlow, and you (15 minutes)

**TL;DR: We use [Git](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) with a [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow to develop Brainbox. Please create new feature branches of `develop` for writing code and then make a pull request to have it added to `develop`.**

For those unfamiliar with it, Git is a system for *version control*, which allows you to make changes to whatever you put into it (Git isn't limited to just code!) that are:

* Tracked (When?)
* Revertable 
* Identifiable (Who? Why?)
* Branching

That last bit is crucial to how we develop brainbox and how Git works.

Git allows for multiple versions of a repository (which is a glorified name for a folder of stuff) that can exist at the same time, in parallel. Each version, called a branch, contains its own internal history and lets you undo changes.

This way you can keep a version of your code that you know works (called `master`), a version where you have new stuff you're still working on (called `develop` in our repository), and branches for trying out specific ideas all at the same time.

For an explanation of the basics of Git, [this guide by Roger Dudler](http://git.huit.harvard.edu/guide/) is a necessary five-minute read on the basics of manipulating a repository.

Brainbox uses [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) as a model for how to organize our repository. This means that there are two main branches that always exist, `master` and `develop`, the latter of which is the basis for all development of the toolbox. If you want to incorporate a new feature into the repository, e.g. a raster plot, you can run the following git command in your repository:

```bash
git flow feature start rasterplot
```

and Git will automatically create a new branch for you to work on and make it active. Once you've created a few commits and feel confident that your code is working well, you can create a pull request on GitHub so we can incorporate your code into the `develop` branch for future release.


# Writing code for Brainbox

We require all code in Brainbox to conform to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines, with [Numpy-style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) docstrings. We require all contributors to use `flake8` as a linter to check their code before a pull request.
