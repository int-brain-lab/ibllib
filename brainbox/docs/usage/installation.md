# Installing Brainbox

## Key Dependencies
Brainbox requires **Python 3.6 or higher**. Other dependencies can be installed using the `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` files in included in brainbox using pip or conda, respectively.

## Brainbox requires ibllib
Brainbox is for the moment a submodule of ibllib, a suite of python code used by the International Brain Lab to support its experimental infrastructure and data analysis pipelines.

## Setting up a conda environment for ibllib
To install brainbox you must first install ibllib via the terminal. This process should be the same for Windows, OS X, and Linux.

```
conda create -n brainbox python=3.7
conda activate brainbox
```

## Clone ibllib into your machine
We will use git in the terminal to clone the GitHub repository for ibllib onto our machine. Windows does not come with git installed. (You can download it here.)[https://gitforwindows.org/]

```
cd ~/Documents # Change this to wherever you want the ibllib directory to live
git clone https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibllib
cd ibllib
git checkout brainbox
```

## Tell python to use brainbox 
Since Brainbox is a submodule of ibllib, we will need to install all of ibllib from the top-level directory. After running the above code to clone ibllib, run the following command: (Be sure you're in the main ibllib directory!)

```
pip install -e .
```

All done! You should now be able to use brainbox from the brainbox conda environment. This means that in new terminal sessions, after you run

```
conda activate brainbox # Or whatever you named the environment
```

Your python installation will have access to brainbox via `import brainbox`.
