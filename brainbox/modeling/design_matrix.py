        Class for generating design matrices to model neural data. Provides handy routines for
        describing neural spiking activity using basis functions and other primitives.

        1395-1403. (2014)

        Parameters
        ----------
        trialsdf : pandas.DataFrame
            Dataframe in which each row is a trial, and each column is a trial-by-trial covariate.
            This includes, optionally, continuous covariates like eye-position and wheel movement
            per trial, which can be used with object-datatype dataframes. The length of vectors
            stored in continuous-variable columns must match the length of the trial.

            Obligatory columns for the dataframe are "trial_start" and "trial_end", which tell the
            constructor which time points to associate with that trial.
        vartypes : dict
            Dictionary of types for each of the columns in trialsdf. Columns must be of the types:
            -- timing: timing events, in which the column values are times since the start of the
                session of an event within that trial, e.g. stimulus onset.
            -- value: scalars which describe a whole-trial value, such as stimulus contrast or
                probability block
            -- continuous: Columns which contain 1-D vectors per row that describe a covariate that
                changes within the trial. e.g. pupil diameter.
            Dictionary keys should be columns in trialsdf, values should be strings that are equal
            to one of the above.
        binwidth : float, optional
            Length of time bins which will be used for design matrix, by default 0.02

        """
        Convenience wrapper for adding timing event regressors to the design matrix.

        Timing events are regressed against using basis functions, such as those generated by the
        functions in this module, which are convolved with a kronecker delta at the time where the
        event occurred. This operation is effectively a copy/paste of the basis functions, each of
        which have their own column in the design matrix. This means that when we fit weights, a
        single weight can govern the prediction of the model over a longer time period.

        Can be offset, such that the bases functions are applied before or after the timing.

        The height of the bases can be modified by a column in the design matrix, which will then
        multiply the delta function which is convolved with the bases.

        Parameters
        ----------
        covlabel : str
            Label which the covariate will use. Can be accessed via dot syntax of the instance
            usually.
        eventname : str
            Label of the column in trialsdf which has the event timing for each trial.
        bases : numpy.array
            nTB x nB array, i.e. number of time bins for the bases functions by number of bases.
            Each column in the array is used together to describe the response of a unit to that
            timing event.
        offset : float, seconds
            Offset of bases functions relative to timing event. Negative values mean bases will
            be applied *before* the timing event by that amount.
        deltaval : None, str, or pandas series, optional
            Values of the kronecker delta function peak used to encode the event. If a string, the
            column in trialsdf with that label will be used. If a pandas series with indexes
            matching trialsdf, corresponding elements of the series will be the delta funtion val.
            If None (default) height is 1.
        cond : None, list, or fun, optional
