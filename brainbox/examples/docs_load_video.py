Get video frames and metadata
===================================
Video frames and meta data can be loaded using the ibllib.io.video module, which contains
functions for loading individual or groups of frames efficiently.  The video may be streamed
remotely or loaded from a local file.  In these examples a remote URL is used.
"""
import numpy as np

import ibllib.io.video as vidio
from oneibl.one import ONE

one = ONE(silent=True)
eid = 'edd22318-216c-44ff-bc24-49ce8be78374'  # 2020-08-19_1_CSH_ZAD_019

# Example 1: get the remote video URL from eid
urls = vidio.url_from_eid(eid, one=one)
# Without the `label` kwarg, returns a dictionary of camera URLs
url = urls['left']  # URL for the left camera

# Example 2: get the video label from a video file path or URL
label = vidio.label_from_path(url)
print(f'Using URL for the {label} camera')

# Example 3: loading a single frame
frame_n = 1000  # Frame number to fetch.  Indexing starts from 0.
frame = vidio.get_video_frame(url, frame_n)
assert frame is not None, 'failed to load frame'

# Example 4: loading multiple frames
"""
The preload function will by default pre-allocate the memory before loading the frames, 
and will return the frames as a numpy array of the shape (l, h, w, 3), where l = the number of 
frame indices given.  The indices must be an iterable of positive integers.  Because the videos 
are in black and white the values of each color channel are identical.   Therefore to save on 
memory you can provide a slice that returns only one of the three channels for each frame.  The 
resulting shape will be (l, h, w).  NB: Any slice or boolean array may be provided which is 
useful for cropping to an ROI.

If you don't need to apply operations over all the fetched frames you can use the `as_list` 
kwarg to return the frames as a list.  This is slightly faster than fetching as an ndarray.

A warning is printed if fetching a frame fails.  The affected frames will be returned as zeros 
or None if `as_list` is True.

# Example 5: load video meta-data
"""
You can load all the information for a given video.  In order to load the video size from a URL 
an instance of ONE must be provided, otherwise this entry will be blank. An Bunch is returned 
with a number of fields.
