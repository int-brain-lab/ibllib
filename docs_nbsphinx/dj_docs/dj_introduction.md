# Introduction to Datajoint

The IBL has collaborated with Datajoint 
DataJoint is a general framework in Python (or Matlab) that allow users to interact with MySQL database with Python 
(or Matlab). To learn more, visit the website https://datajoint.io/, DataJoint Neuro is the team that develop DataJoint 
and help researchers to adopt DataJoint and design pipeline. To check out more, please visit https://djneuro.io/

Datajoint ingests new data generated within the IBL project on a daily basis
Using DataJoint framework, we have been processing data daily within IBL project, and provides a website that display 
the daily training results at https://data.internationalbrainlab.org

# Internal users 
There are three ways in which internal IBL users can use Datajoint to interact with the data stored in the IBL-pipeline
1) Through the datajoint website
 - hosts plots of data generated on a daily basis. Useful for experimenters
2) juyper.internationalbrain la. Datajoint provides a juypter hub permitting access to all data stored within the IBL
pipeline. Can access everything wtihout needing to install (Note you will need a username). The tutorials on the next
couple of pages will still be useful but you do not need to go through process of setting up crendentials
3) As part of iblenv environment, locally. This is the most felxible. If you have already stored, the unified environment
then you are ready to start using datajoint this way. The only thing to do is to set up config and instructions on next 
page will guide you through this and then you can get started with DJ.
