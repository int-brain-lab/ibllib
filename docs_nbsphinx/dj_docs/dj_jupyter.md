# Datajoint jupyter platform for IBL data

ONE provides a set of functions that allow you to search for access and download data IBL data. The ONE functions
connect with Alyx to collect metadata and use this information to download relevant files from FlatIron. ONE is part of
a wider push to allow access to data in any formats. To read more about the background behind ONE see this document.

In order to access IBL data using ONE, we must first set up some credentials that allow us to access data from both Alyx
and Flatiron. Users external to IBL looking to access the publicly available IBL data sets through the ONE method should refer
to the onelight section.



one.alyx.rest allows you to access any of the endpoints on the alyx.
