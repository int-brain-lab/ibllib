# Introduction to ONE

The Open Neurophysiology Environment (ONE) interface consists of a set of simple functions that allow the user to
search for experiments of interest and download the associated data. Within the IBL framework, ONE queries the Alyx
database to find experiments matching the search criterion and downloads the requested data files from the FlatIron
database server. To read in more detail about the ONE interface, please refer to this [section](one_reference)

If you are an IBL member looking to get started with ONE, follow the steps on the [next page](one_credentials) to set 
up your ONE credentials. For external users looking to use ONE to access the IBL public dataset, please refer to the 
[ONE light section](one_onelight).
